  <h3>Background story for the game:</h3>
  <p id="backGround">
Picture this:
    <br>
You're a hedgehog, everyone around you are also hedgehogs (females of course). 
    <br>
THERE ARE ONLY HEDGEHOGS AS FAR AS YOU KNOW.
    <br>
Your country is also very futuristic, so you have the power to build rockets.
    <br>
But oh no! After the goverment built the rocket someone pointed out they don't have the fuel to power it! So they send you on a mission to the old hedgehog witch's place to get fuel from her. You come to her and she tells you she'll give you the fuel only if you teach her about 3 empowering women, because she doesn't know what happens outside.
<br>
    <br>
Our game is based around 3 empowering women's life stories, and is here to help you with your journy! In each minigame you'll be asked to do something - if you succeed, the witch will give you more fuel and your fuel bar on the top of the screen will go up. Good luck and we really hope you'll learn new things and enjoy!
